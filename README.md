## Motivation

We interact with a myriad of systems, and often our mobile phones serve as the central nexus connecting them.
Therefore, it seems almost intuitive to build and run integrations directly on our smartphones.

While there are numerous apps that offer similar functionalities,
the aim of this project is to stand out as an open-source solution.
This means it is not only free to use, but you also have complete visibility into and control over the source code.
This open source is rooted in ensuring the safety of your data and providing transparency,
allowing you to verify and customize the application according to your needs.
